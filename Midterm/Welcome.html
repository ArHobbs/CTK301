		<p>The navigation link boxes are all the same width regardless of the amount of the text inside. Make the nav link backgrounds change when you roll over them. Make sure all the text in the link changes color then you roll over them (even the link in the h1). The main header and navigation have gradients in the background. Clicking on the ISU image in the footer should open up the ISU main site in a new window/tab. All three of your pages ahould have the same format for the headers, navigation, and footer. This paragraph is justified, the others are not. </p>

		<p><a href="https://youtu.be/UUX2FYeP7PA?si=Ml_fHtKpaL2lVPpp&t=27" target="_blank"> Sometimes</a> it believed it was in a universe that was made of energy that was made of offs and ons; zeros and ones; lines of code. Sometimes it believed it was playing a game. Sometimes it believed it was reading words on a screen.<br>

		You are the player, reading words...<br>

		Shush... Sometimes the player read lines of code on a screen. Decoded them into words; decoded words into meaning; decoded meaning into feelings, emotions, theories, ideas, and the player started to breathe faster and deeper and realised it was alive, it was alive, those thousand deaths had not been real, the player was alive<br>

		You. You. You are alive.<br>
			<br>
		And sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the sunlight that came through the shuffling leaves of the summer trees<br>

		and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the light that fell from the crisp night sky of winter, where a fleck of light in the corner of the player's eye might be a star a million times as massive as the sun, boiling its planets to plasma in order to be visible for a moment to the player, walking home at the far side of the universe, suddenly smelling food, almost at the familiar door, about to dream again<br>

		and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the zeros and ones, through the electricity of the world, through the scrolling words on a screen at the end of a dream<br>

		and the universe said I love you<br>

		and the universe said you have played the game well<br>

		and the universe said everything you need is within you<br>

		and the universe said you are stronger than you know<br>

		and the universe said you are the daylight<br>

		and the universe said you are the night<br>

		and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you<br>

		and the universe said the light you seek is within you<br>

		and the universe said you are not alone<br>

		and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing<br>

		and the universe said you are the universe tasting itself, talking to itself, reading its own code<br>

		and the universe said I love you because you are love.<br>

		And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. And the player began a new dream. And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. And the player was the universe. And the player was love.<br>

		You are the player.<br>
